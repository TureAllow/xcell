# xcell

[xcell](https://github.com/tomazy/xcell) is a tiny, open source (MIT)
library for building reactive, spreadsheet-like calculations in JavaScript.

Spreadsheets are coolâ€”if we say that **A1** is the sum of **B1** and **C1**,
the spreadsheet will automatically update whenever we change the dependent
cells.

This usually doesn't happen in our programs.

For example in JavaScript:

```javascript
var b = 1, c = 2

var a = b + c // a is 3 now

b = 42

alert("a is now:  " + a) // it is still 3 :(
```

our variable **a** does not automatically change if we
change **b**. It will be equal to **3** until we *imperatively*
change it something else.

**xcell** allows us to write programs that work like spreadsheets.

Here is how:

```javascript

function add(x, y) {
  return x + y
}

var b = xcell(1), c = xcell(2)

var a = xcell([b, c], add)

alert(a.value) // a is 3

b.value = 42

alert(a.value) // a is 44 \o/
```

`xcell` is a function that returns an object that holds always
updated value, just like a spreadsheet cell.

When we create our "cells" we tell them to either be independent:

```javascript
var b = xcell(1)
```

or to depend on other cells and update its value when necessary using
a provided function:

```javascript
var a = xcell([b, c], add)
```

The cells emit `change` event whenever they change, so we can observe
them and update our UI:

```javascript
a.on('change', function handleChange(sender) {
  document.getElementById("my-cell").value = sender.value
})
```

Here are a few examples of how **xcell** can be used:

- [the real price of a pizza](examples/pizza)
- [mortgage calculator](examples/mortgage)
- [spreadsheet demo](examples/spreadsheet)
